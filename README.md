# ARCHIVE NOTICE: ISC DHCPD reached [end of life](https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/) in 2022. As such, this image will receive no further updates or builds. ISC officially recommends you migrate to [Kea](https://github.com/wastrachan/docker-kea).

# Docker DHCPD

ISC DHCP Server in a Docker container, with configuration files in a volume, and a configurable UID/GID for said files.

## Install

#### Docker Hub

Pull the latest image from Docker Hub:

```shell
docker pull wastrachan/dhcpd
```

#### Manually

Clone this repository, and run `make build` to build an image:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wastrachan/docker-dhcpd.git
cd docker-dhcpd
make build
```

If you need to rebuild the image, run `make clean build`.

## Run

#### Docker

Run this image with the `make run` shortcut, or manually with `docker run`.

```shell
docker run -v "$(pwd)/config:/config" \
           --name docker-dhcpd \
           -e PUID=1111 \
           -e PGID=1112 \
           -p 67:67/udp \
           --restart unless-stopped \
           wastrachan/dhcpd:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

If you wish to run this image with docker-compose, an example `docker-compose.yml` might read as follows:

```yaml
---
version: "2"

services:
  docker-dhcpd:
    image: wastrachan/dhcpd
    container_name: docker-dhcpd
    environment:
      - PUID=1111
      - PGID=1112
    volumes:
      - </path/to/config>:/config
    ports:
      - 67:67/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in the `/config` volume. You may wish to mount this volume as a local directory, as shown in the examples above.

#### User / Group Identifiers

If you'd like to override the UID and GID of the application, you can do so with the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID`. This is helpful if other containers must access your configuration volume.

#### Services

| Service | Port     |
| ------- | -------- |
| DHCP    | 67 (UDP) |

#### Volumes

| Volume    | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `/config` | Configuration directory |
